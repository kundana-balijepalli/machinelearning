# machinelearning
The following machine learning algorithms were built from scratch in Matlab as coursework in Biomedical Engineering. A few topics covered
in this course were:

- Bayesian Decision Theory
- Linear Discriminant Functions
- Multilayer Neural Networks
   - Batch Backpropagation
- Unsupervised Learning & Algorithm-Independent ML
   - Jackknife
   - K means clustering
   = Bootstrap
